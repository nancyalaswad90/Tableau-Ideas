- **Relationships make the analysis experience more intuitive.**


You no longer need to engage in **extensive join planning and make assumptions ** about what join types will be required to make your data ready for analysis. Tableau automatically selects join types based on the fields being used in the visualization. During analysis, Tableau adjusts join types intelligently and preserves the native level of detail in your data. You can see aggregations at the level of detail of the fields in your viz rather than having to think about the underlying joins. Relationships can be many-to-many and support full outer joins. You don't need to use LOD expressions such as FIXED to deduplicate data in related tables.

> ## Project Description


In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.




.




**There are 3 different data sets you can choose from.**

================================================


- Flight Delays and Cancellations

- US Census Demographic Data

- Youtube Data from the US



.






> ## 1)  [Flight Delays and Cancellations]()




==============================================




.



This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.




The file you must use in creating your data visualizations is the `flights.csv` file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the `flights.csv file`, but should not be used **alone.**

### Extra Tip :bulb:

---------------------



.


While this project concerns presenting data in a cohesive and efficient manner using Tableau, there are other popular tools companies use for presenting data. Here’s a sample of them!


- [LOOKER ](https://looker.com/) is a platform used for big data analytics and business intelligence. It is part of the Google Cloud Platform.


- [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) is a service that comes from Microsoft providing interactive visualizations and business intelligence on an interface that connects well with other Microsoft Office Suite tools!


Of course, you can build your own tools using libraries in different statistical or programming languages, like [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) or [plotly](https://plotly.com/) for Python or [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for R.
